### **NOTE:** This is based on the 2.x branch of circuitpython and doesn't yet work on the lastest from the master branch.

In my last post I described how I hacked a 2Mbyte SPI flash onto a
Trinket M0 to give it the memory space for CircutiPython of one of the
M0 Express boards. This time I supersized an M0 Express board,
specifically a Feather M0 Express, although the same hack should work on
a Circuit Playground Express.

Hardware
--------

Replacing the 2Mbyte SPI flash chip with an 8Mbyte version was easy: I
used a solderwick to remove the bulk of the solder on and around the
pins, then gently pulled/pried the chip off while heating the pins (one
side at a time). Then I put a bit of solder on opposite corner pins and
used that to tack the new 8Mbyte chip onto the board. Be careful orient
the chip correctly! To finish I soldered each other pin to the board.
Done.

The one thing that took a bit of effort up front was finding a larger
flash ship that was physically and functionally compatible. I found the
[S25FL064L](http://www.cypress.com/file/316661/download). This is a
hardware drop in replacement with 4 times the space. The chip is
physically bigger as well, but still fits the 8-SOIC footprint and pads.

Software
--------

The only change needed to the firmware was to create a definition file
for the 8Mbyte flash chip, and include that into the Feather config
header. I made a copy of the Feather M0 Express board directory, tweaked
the header file, and added a new flash definition header.

The only change to `boards/feather_m0_express/mpconfigboard.h` (or a
copy, I used `feather_m0_supersized`) is the replacement of the flash
definition with:

    #include "flash_S25FL064L.h"

That `boards/flash_S25FL064L.h` file is just slightly different than
`boards/flash_S25FL216K.h`, specifically the size and JDEC information:

If you made a copy of the `feather_m0_express` directory to
`feather_m0_supersized`, you build (sitting in the
`/circuitpython/atmel-samd` directory) with
`make BOARD=feather_m0_supersized`. If all goes well, you will have the
file `circuitpython/atmel-samd/build-feather_m0_supersized/firmware.uf2`
that you can copy on to the `FEATHERBOOT` usb drive that shows up when
you connect the supersized feather and double press reset.

**Addendum**: Support for this is now included on the 2.x branch.
