What should you get to start making with electronics? Maker.io recently
published a [good
list](https://www.digikey.com/en/maker/projects/d18949ed607a4888a8b5520d554bb117).
While I agree with much of it, I'd make some changes. So here, then, is
my suggestions for setting up a starter lab, as well as ideas for
upgrading later.

Basic setup
-----------

1.  Electronics needs power. A reasonably good bench power supply is
    pretty much manditory. You'll definitely need 5v and probably 3.3v
    as well. 9v or 12v is useful for powering devices that have builtin
    regulation such as Arduinos that have a barrel jack for power (e.g
    the UNO). A clean, steady, reliable source of power in very
    important. Of course, you'll need cables as appropriate. Dyode has a
    [project](https://diyodemag.com/projects/feel_the_power) to use a PC
    power supply as the basis of a bench supply (assuming you have a 3d
    printer).
2.  Breadboarding supplies. My suggestion is to get at the very least a
    couple [full size
    breadboards](https://www.adafruit.com/product/239), but better would
    be what Adafruit lists as a [large
    breadboard](https://www.adafruit.com/product/443). This gives you
    more space and an easy way to connect power. To wire things up you
    will need either some
    [jumpers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/153) or [hookup
    wire](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1311). If you buy loose
    breadboards, try to get them all the same so that you can connect
    them together. Most brands look the same, but not all are inter
    connectable.
3.  Actually, it's a good idea to have plenty of
    [wire](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1311) on hand. To make use
    of the wire, you'll need a wire stripper. Don't use a knife to strip
    wire. You'll damage the wire and/or cut yourself. A proper pair of
    [wire strippers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/527) will take of
    the insulation without touching the wire inside.
4.  Now that you have wire, you need to be able to solder it. Trust me,
    you'll be doing plenty of soldering. Be sure to get a proper
    electronics soldering iron.
    [This](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3685) is a good introductory
    choice. It has decent specs and a very nice price. I would suggest
    you get a more [general purpose
    tip](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1250), though. Be sure to buy
    a proper [iron holder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/150) if your
    iron doesn't come with one.
5.  You need a way to keep your iron tip clean to ensure good heat
    transfer. There are people who like [wet
    sponges](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3540), and people who like
    [brass sponges](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1172). I use both.
    Get one or both and use it every time you take the iron off of its
    holder, and more often if you're doing a lot of soldering at a time.
    Some [tip cleaner/tinner](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00NS4J6BY) is a
    good idea as well.  
   **Never, NEVER, NEVER EVER, flick the iron to shake excess solder
    off. I would to that when I was but a wee lad starting out. The
    problem is that not all the solder comes off at the end out the
    outward flick... more comes off during the jerk back. After a couple
    tshirts that looked like I got hit with buckshot I figured it out
    and thanked my lucky stars it was just my tshirt that got hit with
    it.**
6.  Naturally, you'll need some
    [solder](https://www.adafruit.com/product/145). 22 gauge or slightly
    smaller is good. I wouldn't go bigger than that for electronics
    work. Be sure to get one with a flux core that is marked "no clean".
    Flux helps the solder flow and make good joints, and no clean means
    you don't need to clean the flux off after you finish soldering. 
    There's solder that contains lead, and solder that doesn't. Yeah,
    lead is bad news, but if you wash your hands after soldering, and
    refrain from snacking on it, you'll be fine.
7.  Speaking of safety, some people advise safety glasses and a fume
    extractor. Personally, I've never bothered with either. But at the
    same time, neither is a bad idea, so use them if you like. Working
    in a ventilated area is always a good idea and I work with a window
    open next to my bench when the weather is agreeable. In my opinion
    you should know what you're doing, what the consequences are, and
    make your own decisions.
8.  Once you're able to add solder, you'll find that sometimes you need
    to remove it. You'll want two things for this: a [solder
    sucker](https://www.adafruit.com/product/148) and some [desoldering
    braid](https://www.adafruit.com/product/149). Buying braid in a bulk
    pack is cheaper in the end, and trust me... you'll use it.
9.  One or more pairs of [needlenose
    pliers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/146) are a must have. These
    come in a variety of styles and sizes. A basic pair will suffice to
    get started.
10. [Diagonal cutters](https://www.adafruit.com/product/152) are a
    definite must have. They aren't generally called wire cutters for
    nothing.
11. A vise.  Not a woodworking or mechanics vise, but one for holding
    circuitboards, and such. The [Panavise
    Jr.](https://www.adafruit.com/product/151) is a good one to start
    with. This [Circuit Board
    Holder](https://www.amazon.com/Aven-17010-Adjustable-Circuit-Holder/dp/B00Q2TTQEE)
    is a bit cheaper and reasonable to start with. It's what I started
    out with.
12. I consider a decent [digital
    multimeter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2034) to be an absolute
    necessity.
13. Something that seems obvious, but that is important enough to
    warrant special mention is lighting. Make sure you have good
    lighting. A string LED positionable desk lamp is probably best.

Additional useful items
-----------------------

1.  [Heat shrink tubing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/344) is great
    for bundling wires together, covering connections to prevent shorts,
    and all sorts of other things. It comes in various sizes and
    colours. Variety packs are very common.
2.  [Zip
    Ties](https://www.amazon.com/Adjustable-Durable-locking-Office-Workshop/dp/B075F78RX5)
    are incredibly handy to have in your drawer.
3.  [Tweezers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/422), for picking up and
    positioning small parts and holding wires in place while soldering.
4.  A third hand unit can be very useful for holding wires and small
    pieces that need to be soldered to. It's not necessary, but can be
    handy. If you decide to get some, I advise the [Panavise Third Hand
    add-on](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3019). If you do want to
    get this, or think you might before long, consider the Panavise Jr.
    mentioned in the vise section above as these work well together and
    if you upgrade to the Workcenter (below) the third hand add-on works
    with it as well. Stay away from the cheap third hand units like
    [this](https://www.amazon.com/ProsKit-900-015-Helping-Hands-Soldering/dp/B01E62773K).
    It might be *Amazon's Choice*, but it's a piece of crap. I had one,
    I used it a few times before it fell apart and I tossed it.
5.  Some antistatic precautions can be useful. Most maker electronics
    isn't overly sensitive, but some things can be, and if you walk
    across carpet on the way to your bench you can build up damaging
    amounts of static. Cats are bad for this as well. A simple
    [grounding
    bracelet](https://www.amazon.com/Rosewill-Anti-Static-Components-RTK-002-Yellow/dp/B004N8ZQKY)
    is a cheap and easy precaution. Just make sure it's attached to a
    ground.
6.  So you've breadboarded a circuit. Now you want to solder it up to
    make it more robust. For that you need a board to solder the
    components to. Using [Breadboard
    PCBs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1609) makes it easy... you
    simply move things to the PCB and solder them on. To make things a
    little denser, or a different shape/size you can get [prototyping
    boards](https://www.amazon.com/Prototyping-PerfBoard-Electrical-Engineers-Circuitry/dp/B0749FPZXH)
    in various shapes and sizes. I have a drawer full of such things so
    that I always have a board available to hack stuff onto.

Upgrades
--------

Over time as you do more, and get better at it, you will likely wear out
your cheaper starter gear, or get to the point where you want something
better.

1.  Your soldering iron is probably the first thing you'll upgrade. The
    [Hakko FRX-888D](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1204) is a great
    upgrade. Not cheap, but it's high quality and works great for
    regular, extended use.
2.  The circuit board vise is another early upgrade. The higher end
    [Panavise Multipurpose
    Workcenter](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2452) is a beautiful
    thing to use.
3.  Tools like pliers, cutters, solder sucker, etc. There's always a
    better quality version out there. The better ones stand up to more
    use and generally work better.
4.  Likewise, there are an overwhelming variety of meters available. You
    will likely want to upgrade at some point.
5.  An oscilloscope is something that will eventually become useful.
    There are scopes at all pricepoints. You can start out with
    something like a [BitScope
    Micro](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2053), and move on later to
    something like a [Rigol
    DS1054Z](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2145).

Summary
-------

These aren't hard & fast rules.  They're more like guidelines. Things
that I found useful as I wandered through my time hacking and soldering
and making in general. Having good equipment makes the work more
enjoyable and less frustrating. Your tools shouldn't get in the way.

That said, don't worry about getting THE RIGHT TOOL to start off. Get
something that will do the job. If you need (or want) to replace it
later, you can do that.

I've put links to products at Adafruit and Amazon, bit there are plenty
of places to get this stuff. I got most of my initial tools (some I
still use) at Microcenter, Digikey, Mouser, etc. all carry these things.
And Amazon has a wealth of equipment and supplies.

So get some tools. Get some parts. Start making. And have fun.
