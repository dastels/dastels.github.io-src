My goal is to spend all my time designing, building, and writing about projects as well as writing tutorials. I've been managing to do this and stay alive since early 2018. Adafruit pays a bit for guides and HackSpace pays a bit for articles. That covers the bills. Mostly. Most of the time. It's far from ideal, and quite stressful at times.

If you enjoy and/or benefit from the content I produce, please consider throwing a few $ (or $$) my way each month. I have a [Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/dastels) as well as a [Drip page](https://d.rip/dastels).
