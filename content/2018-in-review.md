The year started with me employed by Trov. After a bit over a year I was still having trouble generally hitting my stride despite some good successes. So it was with some relief when a shakeup in the upper levels of technical management cut me loose in, as I recall, in February.

That provided me the time and opportunity to fully pursue somethign else that had been growing since the previous November: writing for Adafruit. It started when I got a early version of the Sino:bit and wrote a guide to using it with the Arduino toolchain, including some display support to link it into Adafruit's GFX library. From then to Feb, I did my usual hacking with the added activity of writing the projects up.
