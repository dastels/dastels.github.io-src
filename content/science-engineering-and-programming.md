What is it that we do? Are we programmers, software engineers, or  
computer scientists? All of the above, some combination, or none?

My thesis is that it depends. All three are real things. All three are
very  
different. Let's look at each, in turn.

### Computer Science

This one seems easy: science that deals with computers and computing.
But what  
is science?

*"Science is both a body of knowledge and a process."*  
[Understanding Science from UC Berkeley](http://undsci.berkeley.edu)

*"The intellectual and practical activity encompassing the systematic
study of  
... structure and behavior ... through observation and experiment.*"  
[Google](https://www.google.com/#q=what+is+science)

So what is computer science?

*"Computer Science (abbreviated CS or CompSci) is the scientific and
practical  
approach to computation and its applications. It is the systematic study
of the  
feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanisation of the methodical  
processes (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition,
representation,  
processing, storage, communication of, and access to information,
whether such  
information is encoded in bits and bytes in a computer memory or
transcribed  
engines and protein structures in a human cell."*  
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science)

So, Computer Science is more concerned with computation and it's
theoretical  
underpinnings. It isn't as concerned with actually building applications
and  
systems. It's more about discovering and creating new and better ways
of  
computation and of building systems.

Developing new algorithms (like the compression algorithm on sitcom  
*Silicon Valley*), creating new languages, compilers, etc. Tony Hoare  
was doing Computer Science when he developed the Quicksort algorithm.
The people at  
Google who created the Go language are doing Computer Science. The guy  
who wrote FlappyBird... not so much.

### Software Engineering

*"the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to
the  
development, operation, and maintenance of software"*

*"Planning, designing, constructing, and testing software to the
rigorous  
standards of an engineering discipline."*

Only a small percentage of the software being written requires
engineering  
rigor. This is software that can not fail under any circumstances. The
ultimate  
example is software for something like space flight systems. If the
software has a  
bug, people can die and billions of dollars can be wasted.

Comprehensive testing and brutal code reviews are the norm.

Examples: medical systems, flight systems, spacecraft systems, and  
reactor control software.

There are some other things that don't directly involve potential loss
of life,  
but which I'd consider Software Engineering. Those are things like the  
compilers that those life critical systems are written with.

Financial software could be considered to require an engineering  
approach, especially if it's your money it's manipulating.

### Programming

This is everything else: games, personal productivity apps, graphics
apps, web apps,  
scripts, most tools, etc. This encompasses most of the software that
gets  
written.

### So what is it we do?

Well, that depends. If you're developing new algorithms, new
programming  
paradigms, or new approaches to computing, then what you're doing is
probably  
Computer Science. If you're designing and implementing a new language,
you're  
probably doing Computer Science.

Chances are you're not doing Software Engineering, despite what the org
chart or  
your business card says. My card says "Lead Software Engineer", but I
don't  
think my job involves engineering. "Lead Programmer & Architect" would
be more  
accurate. Some of the things I do involve a certain amount of Computer  
Science (designing and implementing a general purpose version of Lisp in
Go, for example).

Ask yourself what's the worst that will happen if your code has a bug
or  
crashes. Will a plane fall out of the sky? Will a spacecraft veer of
course and  
wander the solar system, or crash into the moon? (Ok, sometimes that's  
what's meant to happen) Will someone's heart stop  
beating?

Of course, these ideas aren't completely disjoint. It's a continuium  
with the three concepts being the extremes along their respective  
axis. You will likely move around in it as you work: sometimes doing  
some research, sometimes some engineering, and sometimes just slinging  
code.

What about Software Craftsmanship?
----------------------------------

Craftsmen make nice, well made, useful things. Well, that's the idea.
And  
there's nothing wrong with that; we all need well crafted things that
work well.  
Software is no different. To me, the whole idea of Software
Craftsmanship is  
marketing spin for consulting companies. It's simply programmers doing  
a good job. Granted not all programmers do a good job. Maybe that's  
the moral of this post... Do a good job. And stop worrying so much  
about what's on your business card. You're probably "just" a  
programmer. And that's something to be proud of.
