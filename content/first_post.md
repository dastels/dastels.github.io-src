Summary: I've moved to a different blog tech/hosting

I was writing on my blog a bit, then I started writing for Adafruit and HackSpace, which started taking all my time. That's fallen into somethign of a cadence and I have time (and projects) to write under my own banner as well once again.

This hit hom when the annual Wordpress.com renewal reminder came around. At the same time I saw a friend talk about setting up her personal blog/site. As she is a Pythonista (and on the board even) she went with a Python based solution: Pelican. It supported github pages for hosting.

Since I was thinking about it anyway, and balking at the Wordpress bill, and figured I'd try it out.  I'll be writing more soon, as well as moving over some of the better content from the old version.
